        "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs and information retrieval systems. It’s useful to answer questions or generate content leveraging external knowledge. There are two main steps in RAG: 1) retrieval: retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base with text embeddings stored in a vector store; 2) generation: insert the relevant information to the prompt for the LLM to generate information. In this guide, we will walk through a very basic example of RAG with four implementations:\n",

        "#### Considerations:\n",
        "- **Chunk size**: Depending on your specific use case, it may be necessary to customize or experiment with different chunk sizes and chunk overlap to achieve optimal performance in RAG. For example, smaller chunks can be more beneficial in retrieval processes, as larger text chunks often contain filler text that can obscure the semantic representation. As such, using smaller text chunks in the retrieval process can enable the RAG system to identify and extract relevant information more effectively and accurately.  However, it’s worth considering the trade-offs that come with using smaller chunks, such as increasing processing time and computational resources.\n",
        "- **How to split**: While the simplest method is to split the text by character, there are other options depending on the use case and document structure. For example, to avoid exceeding token limits in API calls, it may be necessary to split the text by tokens. To maintain the cohesiveness of the chunks, it can be useful to split the text by sentences, paragraphs, or HTML headers. If working with code, it’s often recommended to split by meaningful code chunks for example using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser.\n",

        "- **Retrieval methods**: There are a lot different retrieval strategies. In our example, we are showing a simple similarity search with embeddings. Sometimes when there is metadata available for the data, it’s better to filter the data based on the metadata first before performing similarity search. There are also other statistical retrieval methods like TF-IDF and BM25 that use frequency and distribution of terms in the document to identify relevant text chunks.\n",
        "- **Retrieved document**: Do we always retrieve individual text chunk as it is? Not always.\n",
        "    - Sometimes, we would like to include more context around the actual retrieved text chunk. We call the actual retrieve text chunk “child chunk” and our goal is to retrieve a larger “parent chunk” that the “child chunk” belongs to.\n",
        "    - On occasion, we might also want to provide weights to our retrieve documents. For example, a time-weighted approach would help us retrieve the most recent document.\n",
        "    - One common issue in the retrieval process is the “lost in the middle” problem where the information in the middle of a long context gets lost. Our models have tried to mitigate this issue. For example, in the passkey task, our models have demonstrated the ability to find a \"needle in a haystack\" by retrieving a randomly inserted passkey within a long prompt, up to 32k context length. However, it is worth considering experimenting with reordering the document to determine if placing the most relevant chunks at the beginning and end leads to improved results.\n",
